Quiz
A Flutter quiz app is a mobile application that allows users to take quizzes on a variety of topics using the Flutter framework, which is an open-source mobile application development platform created by Google. The app typically consists of a user interface that displays the quiz questions, multiple-choice answers, and a submit button.

When the user selects an answer and clicks the submit button, the app checks if the answer is correct and updates the user's score. The app may also include features such as a timer, hints, and the ability to share quiz results on social media platforms.

Flutter provides a fast and efficient way to build high-quality, cross-platform mobile apps, and has many built-in features that are useful for creating quiz apps, such as widgets, animations, and state management tools. With Flutter, developers can create interactive and engaging quiz apps that are both visually appealing and user-friendly.
